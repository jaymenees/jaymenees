Hi there! My name is Jay Menees. I am a doctoral student in the Higher Education Administration program at the University of Florida.

I am currently working on several grant funded projects under the guidance of Dr. Justin Ortagus. I am also working paper with Dr. Frank Fernandez related to college admissions policies.

I hail from Memphis, TN. I am a massive fan of the University of South Carolina Gamecocks, my "chug" Cindy Lou, disc golf, and the entire Zelda series.
